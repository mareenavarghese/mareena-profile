  about: [
    "I am a full-stack engineer with a strong interest in cybersecurity and system resilience. Over the past five years, I have built cloud-based applications using modern web technologies, while also developing a security-first mindset grounded in real-world threat models.",
    "I recently graduated with a Master’s in Applied Cybersecurity from Federation University Australia, where I focused on digital forensics, incident response, and secure system architecture. I am particularly interested in understanding how systems fail, how evidence can be preserved, and how organisations can respond effectively to cyber incidents."
